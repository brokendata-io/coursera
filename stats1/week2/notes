Leccture 3: variables 
******************************************************************
Types of Variables in Stats 
-Nominal 
-Ordinal 
-Interval 
-Ratio 


Nominal: 
-used to assigned individual cases of categories 
  -example, Coursera students come from different countries: Country of origin is nominal -- Allows you to dist

Ordinal: 
-used to rank order cases 
  -for example, counrtires may be ranked according to population 
  -ranking is an ordinal variable

Interval:
  -used to rank order cases and the distance or interval between each value is equal 
  -for example each country has a longitude and latitue

Ratio: 
-the same as interval variables but they have a true 0 point 
  -for example population is a ratio variable because it has  a 0 point
  -examples: age, population, temperature -- all of these have true 0 points

Lecture 3.2: Histograms: 
*********************************************************************
Histogram: 
-helps us overcome our natural tendency to rely on summary information

x axis - whatever variable you are looking at 
y axis - frequency 

Normal Distribution looks likea  bell curve, symetrical around the mean
